# EnglishPremierLeague-Chatbot

1. A conversational agent has been developed using the google platform DialogFlow CX which is capable of providing information and insights on the English Premier League (EPL) season 2022. The agent has 
two intents, namely GetInfo and Other (Figure 1), and ten slots including participating teamâ€™s name. The flow is designed in a way that the GetInfo intent will be triggered when a user requests information related to Premier League, and the Other intent is triggered for any other queries.  

2. Created an extended version of the conversational agent by developing an HTML page called "The Soccer Spot" that allows users to access information about the EPL 2022 teams. Integrated the DialogFlow CX agent into the page and customized the chat window to improve the user experience.
